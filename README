Installation

Here are the steps I went through to install Formhub-Loader in Mac OS-X. The release is an eclipse project. 

  If you don't already have a Java Runtime Environment installed this is necessary for running eclipse.

  First, I download the latest version of eclipse from: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

  Next, this being ant build project, install ant plugin for eclipse.  

Next, I cloned the repo:

  cd ~/Documents

  git clone git@github.com:modilabs/Formhub-Loader.git

Build the Eclipse Project:

  run Eclipse

  change the workspace to Formhub-Loader

  run an ant build on build.xml

  This step will build an executable jar file in the /dist directory. Use the jar for uploading odk files to formhub.
